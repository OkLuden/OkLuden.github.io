                <div id="divider"></div>
                <p id="text">I am a 20 year old Computer Science student living in Cork, Ireland. <br>
                I was born in Poland, but moved at a young age. In my early years I discovered an interest in art. <br>
                I loved to create and watch my ideas come to life on paper! As I grew up I sprinkled <br>
                my creativity into everything I did. After highschool I decided I would like to pursue a career in technology <br>
                and share my creations digitally. <br>
                <br>
                Now I am a hobby digital artist and computer science student. <br>
                I will continue to expand my horizon and discover new ways of sharing my creativity with the world! <br></p>

                <p id="text">
                    This website was fully developed by me. <br>
                    HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript were used to develop this website, but I'd <br>
                    like to expand my ability and implement a wider range of languages into my work. <br>
                    <br>
                    After a few years of learning various coding languages and programming skills, <br>
                    HTML and CSS particularly stood out to me. Being able to develop something <br>
                    from scratch and watching it progress as you code made me fall <br>
                    in love with the languages and I hope to do much more work with them in the future.
